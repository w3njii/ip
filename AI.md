### What I used AI for

- Asked ChatGPT (GPT-5) for guidance on:
    - Whether I need to write Javadoc for custom exceptions.
    - Writing Javadoc for my main `Steven` class and `TaskList` class.
    - Helping me edit the Javadoc for my `Storage` class to be more clear and precise.
- Generating JavaDoc for the classes in steven.command
  - After copying over the generated JavaDoc, I made some edits for wording and accuracy 

### Observations
- The AI produced clear Javadoc templates quickly, which made it easy to make some minimal edits.
- Saved time: Instead of manually writing documentation from scratch, I could focus on editing the generated comments to be more accurate.
- What worked well: getting Javadoc generated quickly, with consistent formatting.
- What didnâ€™t: the AI sometimes gave slightly verbose Javadoc, so I trimmed it down.

### Time Saved
- An estimate of 1 to 1.5 hours, as the TaskList class is the longest and requires the most Javadoc.
- An estimate of 1 to 2 hours for the classes in steven.command
