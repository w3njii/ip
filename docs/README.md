## Exit the chatbot
- simply type the command `bye` and Steven will exit its program

## Errors
- As human beings, we can always make errors when typing in a command or specifying a parameter
- Steven has error detection and handling, and it will tell you what error you have made when typing a command
- You can then easily find where you have made an error and correct it immediately 

## Unknown command
- Unlike certain chatbots, if you type gibberish by mistake, Steven will not exit and terminate the program because 
it has been specially designed to handle unknown commands
- Steven will politely respond with `????` when the command you have sent is unknown to Steven

## Real-time local save
- Steven will save your task list to your local computer every time it changes
- Even if you don't exit the chatbot in the way it was designed, i.e. by using the `bye` command, Steven will still 
save your latest changes in your task list and you will be able to retrieve it the next time you run Steven

## Amazing GUI
- This one doesn't need any explanation, just run it and be wowed
